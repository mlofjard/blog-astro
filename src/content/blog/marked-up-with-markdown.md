Desperate, as always, for lowering my blogging threshold I implemented [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax for the blog.

As I did this through use of the [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked/) plugin I lost support for inline HTML (might be a setting though). For a few hours this means that my old blog posts will look ugly until I've gone through the backlog and converted it to Markdown.
