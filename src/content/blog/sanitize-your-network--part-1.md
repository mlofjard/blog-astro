## Background
After 15 years of marriage, 2 kids and a full time job, my home network was starting to look
a little worse for wear. So I decided to do something about it.

## The before
Most home networks are made up from crappy consumer hardware and ISP provided equipment. Mine was no different.
I abandoned the ISP provided routers some 25 years, but still continued using of-the-shelf consumer hardware
that has been "upgraded" and replaced over the years to support newer WLAN speeds and standards.

* Crappy D-Link router
  * battle with neighbours for wifi superiority
  * stability (reboot schedule)
* Alexa
  * music in kitchen
  * egg timers
* IKEA Gateway
  * wierd disconnects
  * low bind control?
* Tellstick.net lite v3
  * not great local control
* Broken NAS
  * celeron solder fix
  * disk failure
  * broken backplane
* Server with lots of containers
  * broken power supply
  * move to nuc
