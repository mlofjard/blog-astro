I've been hacking away at the blog again and made a little nifty photo uploader for the admin area. It resizes the image on the client (browser) before uploading it with Ajax which is great because now I can upload directly from my phone without worrying about file size. 

The uploader really needs its own blog post but I'm heading out so in the meanwhile, here is a sneak preview of things to come!

Oh, that's right; inline pictures are working as well. 

Remember to refresh your browser cache if stuff looks weird.
