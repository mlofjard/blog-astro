Last year me and some of my work mates decided to go to the [&Oslash;redev](http://ordedev.org/2011) conference in Malm&ouml;, Sweden. It turned out to be both educational and a lot of fun, so naturally I'm going this year as well.

&Oslash;redev is a 5 day conference starting on November 7 so I'll be there for the better part of next week. We decided to do a four day visit (as we did last year) and go home on thursday evening.

When we registered (almost as soon as one could) there wasn't a whole lot of things that we were interested in on the schedule for friday but a few weeks ago they put in a Windows 8-track on that day and now I'm sorry that I'm going to miss it.

My family on the other hand might appreciate having me home, or at least I hope they will.

I will try to write some posts while I'm there but I'm not sure if I'm going to have the time to put them up until I get home.
