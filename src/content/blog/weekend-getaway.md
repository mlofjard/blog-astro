I'm leaving for Gothenburg in a couple of hours for some all-weekend-hacking-codapalooza-marathon-event-thingy (A.W.H.C.M.E.T?). It's going to be awesome!

Also, I'll get to enjoy the company of some great friends and some great minds (not at all mutually exclusive).

I have a pretty neat idea that has been brewing in the back of my mind for a few days. I'm going to put this weekend (and as many of those great minds as I can persuade) into it and see if it pans out to something usable. I might even tell you about it someday. =)
