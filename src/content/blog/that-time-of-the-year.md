I once again have come to realize that I've ignored my blog, yet again, for an extended amount of time. When this happens my usual response is to delete all my old posts, change the layout and start over.

This time, however, I thought about, for a while, why all my previous blogging atempts have failed and came to the conclusion that I don't really like any of the blog engines that I have used in the past. Mostly I think because they've 		made it quite cumbersome to blog "on-the-go". So this time around I decided to do things differently.

What you're looking at right now is (at the time of writing this) a static html page being server to you by an Apache web server running on an old laptop in my closet. This however is about to change. In the coming weeks I'm going to 		write a new blog engine using my new favourite tool; [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org).  
I'm not writing yet another blog engine so that the world can have more choice, I'm writing it because I'm hoping that in doing this, and at the same time posting about my progress, I will build enough momentum to keep this blog going. I also plan on making it as simple as possible to post new stuff from my new favourite toy; my Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9.
