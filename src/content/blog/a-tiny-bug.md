I've been using (and still am in production) an old JavaScript function called `parseInt` when parsing my DateTimes for comments and posts. For some reason it showed some weird behavior today.

I noticed a comment that was written on December 0. I looked it up in the database and it turns out it was actually written on December 8. Now the 8 should have been parsed from the DateTime `2011-11-08 ...` into the string `"08"` and then I assumed `parseInt` should have gotten rid of that extra 0 for me.

I found my problem in the `parseInt` documentation over at w3schools.

> If the string begins with any other value, the radix is 10 (decimal)  

`parseInt` works fine for the strings "01" through "07" and of course for any string beginning with a "1". The deprecated "string begins with a zero"-feature was the culprit.

So today I learned something new; use `Number()` instead.
