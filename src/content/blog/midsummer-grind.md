Here's my latest project:

![Sanded down keys](/img/upload/61f7f626-f25f-42f0-9bd5-d9cf30e66abb.jpg)

It's taking me a lot longer to sand down all the keys with 180 grit sand paper than I originally planned, but a few more hours and I'll be ready for paint.

Having kids though, I might not be able to complete it until next weekend. :)

Oh and yes; that's a Logitech Wave I'm modifying...
