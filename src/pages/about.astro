      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
         My name is Mikael Lofj√§rd, and I'm a <s>29</s> <s>30</s> 40+ year old software
         developer/architect working at 11K. I currently live
         outside of Stockholm, Sweden with my wife and two daughters.
      </p>

      <h2>The past</h2>
      <p>
         I grew up in the town of Varberg, on the west coast of Sweden. Here I
         got my first taste of programming at the age of 10 (well technically I
         was about to turn eleven in a few months) when I managed to get my
         hands on a copy of the freshly released Visual Basic 3.0. I was
         completely amazed with the fact that I could now create my own Windows
         programs. Without any internet or books at hand I tried to make due
         with trial and error but, suffice to say, my programs never really did
         anything advanced. They where however my own creations and as such I
         was immensely proud of them.
      </p>
      <p>
         A few years later, a few of my friends had gotten their first dialup
         internet connections and I started taking an interest in how to make
         websites, even though I had no internet connection of my own yet.
      </p>
      <p>
         My programming interest really grew into a full time obsession when I
         started high school (school year 10-12 in Sweden) since, for the first
         time, I got to select for myself what I wanted to study and thus ended
         up hanging out with a bunch of like-minded people. From there on out
         its been an amazing journey of discovery and learning.
      </p>

      <h2>The (somewhat) present</h2>
      <p>
         I had my go at college but it turned out it wasn't for me. I made a lot
         of really great friends and I enjoyed all the programming courses, but
         I somehow felt that all the math and technical engineering courses
         didn't really bring anything to the table that I would have any use for
         in my future profession. Thus I dropped out after just two years.
      </p>

      <p>
         Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to college. Education is very
         important when looking for a job these days. What I'm trying to say is
         that I found that most of my required courses didn't interest me, and
         when I'm not interested in what I'm trying to learn it doesn't matter
         how much I study because I'm never going to get it anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
         It turns out that it was the right decision for me, because in all my
         years of working as a programmer I have only used ONE thing I learned
         in college and even that wasn't really critical to the task I was
         doing.
      </p>

      <p>
         I currently work as a software architect/developer at a small
         consulting firm here in Sweden and it's a job that I really
         enjoy.
      </p>

      <h2>The future</h2>
      <p>
         I tend not to think about the future to much, and I'm currently very
         happy with where I am in life, but you always need something to aspire
         to and so I shall at least try to explain what I want from life.
      </p>

      <p>
         Regarding my personal life; we've been thinking about getting a house
         for a while, but at the moment we're thinking about maybe saving up
         some money and move to the west coast (to be closer to my relatives) in
         5-10 years. Somehow that plan always seems to change from week to week.
      </p>

      <p>
         Professionally, I couldn't be happier about where I work or the people
         I work with, but one can never know what the future holds.
      </p>

      <p>
         If I was to work someplace else the most important thing for me would
         be the people I work with. I may aspire to be the best in my field, but
         if I don't work with people who are better than me then I'm not
         interested.
      </p>

      <p>
         I'm not sure who said that but I strongly agree with it. I can learn a
         lot from reading blogs and technical articles (and I do) but learning
         something without discussing the meaning of it with people who you look
         up to, doesn't really amount to much in my opinion.
