This weekend I've been at home with some kind of wierd illness. At first I thought it was <del datetime="2011-11-21T15:55+01:00">angina</del> <ins datetime="2011-11-21T15:55+01:00">bacterial tonsillitis</ins> since that's what my daughter came down with right before I left for &Oslash;redev. But now I'm thinking it's something viral. Not in the Internet pretty-pictures-of-kittens way but an actual virus.

I've been having some fever but it hasn't been that serious and my throat has been really soar, but it never really took of the way my daughters <del datetime="2011-11-21T15:55+01:00">angina</del> <ins datetime="2011-11-21T15:55+01:00">tonsillitis</ins> did.

However, I've been totally knocked down by it. I spend half the day in bed and the other half knocked out on the couch. So far it doesn't sound all that different from my normal weekends but trust me, it's different.

I've decided to name this illness "Programming flu". What this programming flu does is take away all of your creativity. I've been staring at my blog this whole weekend without having the slightest idea of what to write about.

I usually have 5-6 things I wanna try out and at least one of them usually gets done and then written about. These are some of the things I planned to do this weekend:

* Finish coding the administration interface for the blog
* Try out some new layout stuff on the blog (maybe a side bar)
* Get my new USB server hooked up with my [Tellstick](http://www.telldus.se/)
* Write some software to control my lighting and home theater equipment
* Continue working on SplitCode for my next Tuesday tutorial at work

I've managed to get half way through the first one. In fact this is the first post written in the blog's administration interface instead of in Couch's.

But every time I've sat at the computer thinking of getting started on one of the other things and then blog about it, something keeps making me do something else. Programming flu is not fun.

I'm still not well so I'm calling in sick tomorrow. But my wife is going to work tomorrow and my daughter has day care so I'm hoping my programming flu will have eased off a bit tomorrow so I can finally get some work done. Hopefully there will be some code for you by tomorrow evening.

<ins datetime="2011-11-21T15:55+01:00">UPDATE: Some people pointed out the fact that angina probably wasn't the transalation I was looking for and that what I really meant was tonsillitis. Never trust the first translation dictionary you find on the web.</ins>
