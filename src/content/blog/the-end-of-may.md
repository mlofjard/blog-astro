The blog has been silent lately but i certainly have not been sitting still. About a month ago I started to remake the administration area of the blog into something a bit more fashionable (today it consists of a few input boxes and a "publish" button). Halfway through I decided to rewrite it using AngularJS. Needles to say, I'm not quite done with it yet but it's a work in progress and it's going to be awesome.

My great friend and fellow coder Mattias spent a long weekend here and we put together a little P2P file sharing site using Node.js, AngularJS and Web RTC data channels. It's really cool but like most things, it needs a little more work. It's [up on GitHub though](https://github.com/mlofjard/WebDrop) if anyone wants to take a peek at it.

The day before yesterday I beefed up security on my server and it's been quite interesting seeing who gets banned from trying to log in to every account known to man through SSH.

__Spoiler alert!__ It's Chinese authorities. =)

I might do a blog post about it someday in the near (or far) future.

In other news; my wife gets more and more pregnant every day, the weather is awesome most days so I really should get a move on with my robot, and I'm really hung-over today from attending a company event last night. We played Segway-polo. It was awesome! =)
