If you're reading this blog I expect you to have a somewhat technical side to your personality and thus I assume you have a pretty up-to-date browser.  
This blog is made with HTML5 and CSS3 and at the moment I have not done any work at all to make it cross browser compatible. I have Chrome 15 (my current default browser), IE 9, Firefox 7 and Opera 11.52 installed on my machine and it works in all of them (except the "border-radius" attribute which doesn't work on images in Opera).  
Somewhere down the line I might incorporate some fixes for older browsers but unless you're stuck at work, in a government company running Windows XP and IE 8, please upgrade your browser. The rest of the world wide web is just out there waiting for you to experince it in a better way!

So what kind of stuff am I planning on using to develop this blog engine?  
Here's a list:

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) - Evented I/O for V8 JavaScript.
* [node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static) - A better way of serving up static files in node.js.
* [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) - A NoSQL document database.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - The one javascript framework to rule them all.
* [Mustach](http://mustache.github.com/) - Logic less templating framework.
* [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html) - The way the web should be done.
* [CSS3](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/) - All the magic styling stuff made easy

I've probably forgotten something but if I figure it out, I'll at least have something to write another post about. =)
