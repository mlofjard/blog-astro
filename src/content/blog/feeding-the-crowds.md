For a while now I've been trying to decide between ATOM and RSS for by blog feed, and yesterday one of our company's owners asked me for a feed to my blog so that he could consume it at our new company web site.

I've finally decided to create an ATOM feed and if anyone has any problems consuming it, please contact me and I will try to fix it.

For now it's not a full feed. Each entry contains the same amount of text as the archive listings since I've yet to figure out what to do about all the source code that's in my blog posts. The source code formatting relies heavily upon CSS and I'm not even sure that I want my full posts in the feed.

Until I've made up my mind it will work mainly as a way of getting notified of new posts without having to visit the web site.
