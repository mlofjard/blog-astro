The blog is now up and running on the new server (called <abbr title="Itty Bitty Server">IBS</abbr>).

I'm not totally retiring the laptop yet as I might need it when the next Ubuntu LTS hits. And I have yet to try out if it's the Atom processor that makes CouchDB run a little slower on the new machine or if it's a 64-bit/SMP issue.

Anywhooo, I'm going to let it run for a few days to see if it's up to the task so there might be some issues, resulting in unexpected downtime, popping up in the coming week. Do not be alarmed! =)
