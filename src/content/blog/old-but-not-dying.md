Tuesday the 25th of September 2012 marks my 30th birthday.

Even though I might not be fresh meat anymore, I haven't forgotten about my blog. I've just been busy (raise your hand if you've heard that one before).

## The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Me...

* I've been planning an article about my success in getting my laptop installed with Arch Linux on UEFI, but I've yet to complete it.
* I've also redesigned the blog and it now looks like crap in Firefox.
* I then fixed the Firefox bugs but have'nt gotten around to uploading them because of my next bullet point.
* My server operating system/software stack is ooooold. :-)

## Planned maintenance

My pretty little server <abbr title="Itty Bitty Server">IBS</abbr> is running Ubuntu Server 10.4 LTS. My original plan was to update it to 12.04 LTS as soon as it was released but, needless to say, that didn't happen. I've since fallen in love with Arch Linux.

As I was fixing my Firefox rendering issues I also happened to update all of my node.js plugins on my workstation. This required some rewriting of my code which in turn is why I haven't uploaded it yet.

Even though I haven't updated my blog for the whole of summer, I still hate downtime, and uploading the latest code would require some downtime as it is now depending on newer versions of node.js and a lot of newer plugins.

AND... if I'm going to do maintenance on the server I might as well reinstall the whole machine and run Arch Linux on it.

I'm also planning a major rewrite of my underlying structure to move from a pure node.js server to a [nginx](http://nginx.org/)/node.js mix.  
It's a move I've been contemplating for a while since I've been having some problems with my implementation of virtual domains in conjuncture with my speedy in-memory caching.

#### tl;dr
I'm not dead, just old(er). The blog still lives. Planned maintenance has been keeping me from fixing stuff. Life (vacations/kids/work/barbecuing) has gotten in the way of me writing semi-interesting blog posts this past summer.
