... it's just a flesh wound.

Jokes aside, I had planned to make a post last Monday about some HTTP HEAD/GET/POST and header request stuff I've done on the blog recently but something got in the way of me completing my work.

I still plan to do it when I get some spare time, but for now a simple I'm-still-here-post will have to suffice.

The last couple of weeks have been filled with work, migraines, sore throats and birthday parties. I also started watching a Canadian TV-series from 2004 called ReGenesis and it's been taking up most of my time at night. I'm almost halfway through the 4th and final season now, so I'm expecting more blogging to be done in the coming week.
