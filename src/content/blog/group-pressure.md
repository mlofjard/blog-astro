In a totally unoriginal move I'm now starting to wean myself off Facebook, starting by deleting the Facebook app from my phone and tablet.

Since almost everyone else in the tech sector seems to have done the same thing at least once, I don't feel that I have to post any particular reason for doing so other than being tired of it.

Since I'm not going cold turkey right away I will still check in on Facebook from my laptop, but the number of "feed reads" will hopefully be few and far between.
