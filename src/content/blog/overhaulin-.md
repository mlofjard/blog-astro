Tomorrow (actually today when I write this) my daughters day care is closed and I get to spend the day with her at home. That meant that I could stay up late tonight and do some work on the blog.

The last few days I've felt that the file sizes were beginning to get out of hand. This easily happens when you're writing JavaScript since it's kind of a cowboy language. I love that I am able to twist and bend the language to my will, but the same thing that makes JavaScript so powerful can also be its worst enemy. It's way to easy to loose control of yourself and before you know it you end up with a 1000-lines-of-code monster file and your head starts spinning every time you want to make a change to it.

So today I rewrote the blog. Not all of the logic, but basically all of the architectural stuff, and I'm quite pleased with the result. I'm going to write some more tomorrow (or later this afternoon, depending on your point of view) about what I've done and a bit on architectural patterns in JavaScript in general.

I was really excited about writing about it right now, but I need to get to bed now.
