The time left before my holiday leave is running out fast and I've got a ton of stuff to do at work. To top it all off, this entire week is filled with urgent stuff to do, when I do manage to get myself home in decent time.

I apologize in advance for the lack of posts this week. I hope to get back up to speed soon.
