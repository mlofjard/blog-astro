While looking at my [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) statistics I noticed that my empty archive page had almost as many hits as the front page.

And so, with little to loose, I set out to create a dynamic [archive](http://lofjard.se/archive).

Now I don't even have paging on my front page yet, but since this is my 10th post I really should make that my next priority.
