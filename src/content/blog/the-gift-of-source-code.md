I'm not sure if anyone is interested in my source code for this blog, but since I've already posted some bits and pieces of it from time to time, I thought, why not release it all?

If your browser has a width of more than 720 pixels, you will see a new button in the menu labeled "Source code". Feel free to browse, and enjoy!

DISCLAIMER: Not all of my code is that pretty and I've been meaning to refactor some of it.

In other news, I'm leaving for the west coast tomorrow morning, so this might be my last post this year. It all really boils down to how tired I will be after playing with all my lovely nephews and nieces all weekend.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
